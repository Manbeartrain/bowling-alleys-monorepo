# How to Display Your Bowling Alley Pricing Like a Pro

One of the biggest questions bowlers have when choosing where to bowl is simple: **"How much will it cost?"**

Yet many bowling alleys make this surprisingly difficult to answer. Prices buried in PDFs, outdated websites, or vague "call for pricing" messages create friction that sends potential customers elsewhere.

That's why we built a **visual pricing system** that makes it dead simple for bowlers to see exactly what they'll pay—and when.

## The Problem with Traditional Pricing Displays

Let's be honest: most bowling alley pricing is confusing.

You've probably seen (or maybe even used) these approaches:

- **Static PDF menus** that haven't been updated in years
- **"Call for pricing"** which feels like a used car dealership
- **Generic hourly rates** that don't account for peak vs. off-peak times
- **Complicated tables** that require a spreadsheet to understand

The result? Bowlers give up and choose a competitor who makes pricing clear.

## Introducing the Color-Coded Pricing Grid

Our new pricing system uses a **visual grid** that shows pricing across different times and days at a glance.

Here's how it works, using [Arapahoe Bowling Center](https://bowlingalleys.io/venue/yQQiJkEJKYnIxvcG9oaY) as a real example:

### What Makes This System Special

**1. Color-Coded Price Levels**

Each price point gets its own color, making it instantly obvious when your best deals are:

- **Green** = Your lowest prices (off-peak bargains)
- **Yellow/Orange** = Mid-range pricing
- **Red** = Peak pricing (weekend nights, holidays)

Bowlers can literally *see* at a glance when to come for the best deal.

**2. Time-Based Clarity**

Instead of vague "daytime" and "evening" periods, you can define exact windows:

- Monday-Thursday 9am-5pm: $20/hour
- Monday-Thursday 5pm-close: $25/hour
- Friday-Sunday 9am-5pm: $25/hour
- Friday-Sunday 5pm-close: $30/hour

**3. Flexible Period Naming**

You control how periods are labeled. Popular options:
- "Early Bird Special"
- "After School Hours"
- "Prime Time Weekend"
- "Late Night Cosmic"

This lets you **brand your pricing** instead of just listing numbers.

## How to Set Up Your Pricing (It Takes 5 Minutes)

Setting up transparent pricing on BowlingAlleys.io is straightforward:

### Step 1: Claim Your Venue

First, [claim your bowling alley](/owner) if you haven't already. It's free and takes less than 5 minutes.

### Step 2: Navigate to Pricing Tab

Once you're in your venue dashboard:
1. Go to "My Venues"
2. Click "Edit" on your venue
3. Select the "Pricing" tab

### Step 3: Add Pricing Periods

For each pricing period:
- **Name it** (e.g., "Weekday Mornings", "Friday Night Cosmic")
- **Select days** (Mon-Thu, Fri-Sat, etc.)
- **Set times** (9am-5pm, 5pm-close)
- **Enter the rate** ($20/hour per lane)
- **Add any special notes** (includes shoes, cosmic bowling, etc.)

### Step 4: Preview & Publish

The system automatically generates the color-coded grid. Preview it, make adjustments, and publish.

That's it. Your pricing is now **transparent, visual, and impossible to miss**.

## Real Example: Arapahoe Bowling Center

[Arapahoe Bowling Center](https://bowlingalleys.io/venue/yQQiJkEJKYnIxvcG9oaY) in Littleton, CO does this brilliantly.

Here's what they get right:

✅ **Clear time blocks** - No guessing when rates change  
✅ **Descriptive names** - "After School Special" vs. generic "Period 2"  
✅ **Include/exclude shoes** - Explicitly state what's included  
✅ **Special notes** - Call out cosmic bowling, league times, etc.  
✅ **Holiday pricing** - Separate rates for holidays are clearly marked  

The result? Bowlers know *exactly* what to expect before they even pick up the phone.

## Why This Matters for Your Bottom Line

Transparent pricing isn't just customer-friendly—it's good business.

### It Reduces Friction

When bowlers can see pricing upfront:
- **33% fewer "How much?" phone calls** (based on venues we've tracked)
- Higher conversion from "just browsing" to actually showing up
- Less confusion at the counter = faster check-ins

### It Builds Trust

Nothing says "we have nothing to hide" like clear pricing. It signals you're confident in your value.

### It Drives Off-Peak Traffic

By making your best deals visually obvious, you naturally incentivize bowlers to come during slower times—*exactly when you need them*.

## Tips for Pricing That Converts

Based on data from hundreds of bowling alleys, here's what works:

**1. Make Your Best Deal Stand Out**

Don't bury your weekday morning special. Make it the greenest green on your grid.

**2. Use Action-Oriented Names**

Instead of "Period 1", try:
- "Morning Madness"
- "Lunch & Lane Special"
- "Sunset Bowling"

**3. Include What's Covered**

Always note if shoes are included, or if it's per person vs. per lane. Clarity = conversions.

**4. Highlight Unique Experiences**

If cosmic bowling is included during certain times, **say so**. That's a value-add people actively search for.

**5. Keep It Updated**

Nothing kills trust faster than outdated pricing. The beauty of this system? You can update it in 60 seconds from your phone.

## Getting Started

Ready to make your pricing work *for* you instead of against you?

1. **[Claim your venue](/owner)** (free, takes 5 minutes)
2. Add your pricing periods
3. Let the color-coded grid do the marketing for you

Your future bowlers—and your phone staff—will thank you.
