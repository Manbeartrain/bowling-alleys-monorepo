# BowlingAlleys.io v1.2.0 - Location Discovery, Leagues & New Experiences

We're excited to announce **BowlingAlleys.io v1.2.0** - a major update focused on smarter location discovery, deeper leagues integration, and new experience pages.

This release brings a user-first approach to location permissions and enhanced venue features for league bowlers.

---

## 📍 Smart Location Discovery

### "Find Alleys Near Me" Button
We've completely redesigned how location works on BowlingAlleys.io with a **user-first permission flow**.

**How It Works:**
- The [Explore](/locations) page now shows random bowling alleys by default
- A prominent "Find alleys near me" button lets you opt-in to location sharing
- Once enabled, venues are sorted by distance with a location indicator
- Your preference is remembered for future visits

**Why This Matters:**
- No more surprise permission popups when you first visit
- You control when and if you share your location
- Better privacy by default

### Auto-Location for Returning Users
If you've previously granted location permission, the site automatically shows nearby alleys - no need to click the button again.

### "Bowling Alleys to Explore" Carousel
The locations page now features a beautiful carousel of bowling alleys:
- Shows random alleys by default
- Switches to "Bowling Alleys Near You" when location is enabled
- Displays distance to each venue

---

## 🏆 Enhanced Leagues Integration

### [Leagues URL Support](/bowling-leagues)
Venues can now link directly to their leagues sign-up page, making it easier for bowlers to join.

**New Features:**
- **FAB Priority**: The floating action button now prioritizes leagues (Reserve > Leagues > Specials > Website)
- **Contact Section**: "Join a League" link appears when a venue has a leagues URL
- **Clickable Leagues Pill**: The "Leagues" amenity badge is now clickable - tap to go directly to sign-up

---

## 🎓 New Bowling Lessons Experience Page

### Bowling Lessons
We've added a dedicated **[Bowling Lessons](/bowling-lessons)** experience page for venues offering instruction and coaching.

**Features:**
- Browse bowling alleys that offer lessons by state and city
- Full sitemap integration for SEO
- Added to the Experiences hub

Perfect for beginners looking to improve their game or parents seeking youth bowling programs.

## 🏙️ New City Hub Pages

### New York City Hub

## 🗺️ Enhanced Locations Page

City-level pages now include photo galleries, "Top 5 Bowling Alleys" rankings, and integrated maps.

---

## 🛠️ Bug Fixes & Performance

### Fixed Blank Page Bug
Resolved a critical issue where users navigating directly to venue URLs would see a blank page. Pages now load reliably with automatic retry logic.

### Simplified Pricing Display
Removed the complex pricing grid in favor of a cleaner "Average Pricing" card - easier to read and understand.
