I spend hours every week looking at bowling alley websites.

And I'll be honest — **most are painful to navigate.**

Here's what I've learned and what you can fix right now to stop losing customers before they even set foot in your alley.

## 1. Show the Info People Actually Want — Without Scrolling

From the moment someone lands on your site, they should instantly see:

- **Your most popular amenities** (as identified by SEO — things like "cosmic bowling," "birthday parties," "arcade," etc.)
- **Your prices**
- **Your location**

If I have to scroll or click three times to find these, I'm gone. That's a **lost booking**.

Think about it: when someone visits your website, they're already interested in bowling at your alley. Don't make them hunt for basic information. Put it front and center.

### Quick Fix:
Create a prominent section on your homepage that displays:
- Game pricing (per game or per hour)
- Shoe rental cost
- Top 3-5 amenities (cosmic bowling, food & drinks, arcade, leagues, birthday parties)
- Your full address with a Google Maps link

---

## 2. STOP MAKING LOCATION HARD TO FIND

I can't tell you how many sites I've reviewed where it takes me **2-3 minutes to find an address**.

That's insane.

Your address should be in your **header or footer**, easy to copy or click. If your customer can't find you in seconds, they're already walking out the (digital) door.

### Quick Fix:
Add your full address to:
- Your website header (top of every page)
- Your website footer (bottom of every page)
- Make it clickable so it opens in Google Maps
- Include a phone number right next to it

This is especially critical for mobile users who want to tap and navigate immediately.

## 3. Embed Your Facebook Feed

Look, I get it — **updating a website is hard**. You pay someone every time you want to change a picture or post an event.

But if you **embed your Facebook feed**, every time you post, it updates live on your site.

That means your customers always see your latest deals, events, and photos — and you don't spend a dime updating your website.

### Quick Fix:
1. Go to [Facebook's Page Plugin tool](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/page-plugin)
2. Enter your Facebook page URL
3. Copy the generated code
4. Have your web developer add it to your homepage

Now every Facebook post automatically appears on your website. Zero maintenance required.

## 4. Build a Professional Website

It's not 2000 anymore.

Building a **clean, fast, and mobile-friendly site** is easier and cheaper than ever.

You know why the big chains dominate? Because they win the digital race — they rank first, their info is accessible, and they make booking easy.

So ask yourself — **if you make it harder, why would the average customer choose your alley?**

### Quick Fix:
If your website looks outdated or doesn't work well on mobile:
- Consider modern website builders like Squarespace, Wix, or WordPress
- Hire a freelance web developer on Upwork or Fiverr (budget: $500-$1,500 for a solid site)
- Focus on mobile-first design — most of your visitors are on phones

A professional website doesn't have to be expensive. It just needs to be **clean, fast, and informative**.

## 5. Use My "Experiences" Tab to Fuel Your SEO

This one's personal.

My site, **[BowlingAlleys.io](/)**, isn't just a directory — it's a living map of the bowling industry.

Every week, I analyze search trends, amenities, and what customers actually look for. That data is public under the **[Experiences tab](/experiences)** — and you can use it to see what's trending, what bowlers care about, and how to attract more customers.

### What You Can Learn:
Visit [BowlingAlleys.io/experiences](/experiences) to see:
- **Popular bowling experiences** (cosmic bowling, leagues, sports bars, birthday parties, etc.)
- **What amenities drive the most searches**
- **How to position your alley** based on what bowlers actually want

If your alley's amenities and details are up to date on BowlingAlleys.io, that's **free visibility** you're leaving on the table.

### Quick Fix:
1. Visit [BowlingAlleys.io](/locations) and find your alley
2. [Claim your listing](/owner) (it's free!)
3. Update your amenities, pricing, and photos
4. Join the [Founding Partners program](/founding-partners) if you're one of the first 50 to claim

Every update you make helps bowlers find you — and it costs you nothing.

The bowling industry is full of passion — but it's **stuck in the past digitally**.
