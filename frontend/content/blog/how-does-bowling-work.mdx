Scoring in bowling can look a little confusing at first, but once you understand the basics, it’s surprisingly simple. On BowlingAlleys.io, we want to make it easy for beginners to enjoy the game without worrying about complicated score sheets. In this guide, we’ll walk you through the essentials: strikes, spares, and open frames.

## Step 1: Understand the Frame System
A game of bowling has **10 frames**. In each frame, you get up to two chances to knock down all ten pins. The goal is simple: knock down as many pins as possible. Your score depends on how you do in each frame, and whether you finish with a strike, spare, or open frame.

- **Maximum score possible:** 300 (12 strikes in a row).
- **Most games for beginners:** Fall between 70–120, and that’s completely normal!

## Step 2: What is a Strike?
A **strike** happens when you knock down all ten pins with your first ball in a frame. On the scoreboard, it’s marked with an **“X.”**

Scoring a strike gives you **10 points plus the total pins from your next two rolls.**  
Example: If you roll a strike, then knock down 4 pins and 3 pins in your next frame, the strike frame is worth **17 points** (10 + 4 + 3).

Strikes are the fastest way to build a high score, which is why bowlers love them!

## Step 3: What is a Spare?
A **spare** happens when you knock down all ten pins in two tries within the same frame. On the scoreboard, it’s marked with a **“/.”**

Scoring a spare gives you **10 points plus the total pins from your next roll.**  
Example: If you roll 7 pins, then 3 pins (a spare), and then hit 5 pins on your next ball, the spare frame is worth **15 points** (10 + 5).

Think of a spare as a solid recovery—it keeps your score moving forward.

## Step 4: What is an Open Frame?
An **open frame** happens when you don’t knock down all ten pins within your two tries. No bonuses are added—you simply score the total pins knocked down in that frame.

Example: If you knock down 6 pins on your first ball and 2 pins on your second, the open frame is worth **8 points.**

Open frames are common for beginners, and that’s okay! The key is to keep improving little by little.

## Step 5: The 10th Frame Special Rules
The **10th frame** is unique. If you roll a strike or spare, you earn extra throws to complete your score:

- **Strike in 10th:** You get 2 more rolls.  
- **Spare in 10th:** You get 1 more roll.  
- **Open frame in 10th:** No extra rolls.

This is why you’ll sometimes see players throw 3 balls in the final frame.
