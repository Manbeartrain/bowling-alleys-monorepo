# What Is Candlepin Bowling? A Beginner's Guide to New England's Unique Bowling Style

If you've ever visited New England and walked into a bowling alley, you might have encountered something strange: **tiny bowling balls with no finger holes** and **skinny pins that look like candles**. Welcome to the world of **candlepin bowling** — one of the most challenging and unique bowling variants in America.

Let's break down everything you need to know about this regional favorite.

## What Makes Candlepin Bowling Different?

Candlepin bowling is a **bowling variant** that originated in Massachusetts in 1880. Unlike the standard ten-pin bowling most people know, candlepin uses different equipment and follows unique rules.

### The Equipment

**Candlepin Bowling Ball:**
- **Weight**: Only 2 lbs 7 oz (compared to 6-16 lbs for ten-pin)
- **Size**: About 4.5 inches in diameter (fits in one hand)
- **No finger holes**: You grip the entire ball in your palm
- **All balls are the same weight**: No choosing heavy or light balls

**Candlepin Pins:**
- **Shape**: Tall and cylindrical, resembling a candle (hence the name)
- **Height**: 15.75 inches tall
- **Weight**: 2 lbs 8 oz each
- **Base**: Tapered at both ends, making them harder to knock down

**The Lane:**
- Same 60-foot length as ten-pin bowling
- Same 41.5-inch width
- Similar oil patterns, but less forgiving

## How Do You Play Candlepin Bowling?

### Basic Rules

1. **Three balls per frame** (instead of two in ten-pin)
2. **Ten frames per game** (just like regular bowling)
3. **Fallen pins ("deadwood") stay on the lane** — you can use them to knock down standing pins
4. **No re-racking between balls** in the same frame
5. **Maximum score: 300** (though it's never been achieved!)

### Scoring

- **Strike**: Knock down all 10 pins on your first ball = 10 points + next 2 balls
- **Spare**: Knock down all 10 pins within 3 balls = 10 points + next ball
- **Open frame**: Whatever pins you knock down

The scoring system is similar to ten-pin, but strikes and spares are **much harder to get** in candlepin.

## Why Is Candlepin Bowling So Hard?

Candlepin is widely considered **one of the hardest bowling variants** in the world. Here's why:

### 1. **Skinny Pins That Don't Fall Easily**
The tall, narrow shape makes pins incredibly stable. Unlike ten-pin bowling where pins crash into each other, candlepins often remain standing even when hit.

### 2. **Small, Light Ball**
The 2.5-pound ball has very little momentum. You can't rely on sheer force — accuracy and technique matter more.

### 3. **No Pin Action**
In ten-pin bowling, hitting the "pocket" creates a chain reaction where pins knock each other down. In candlepin, there's minimal pin action, so you need **direct hits**.

### 4. **Perfect Game? Never Happened.**
Unlike ten-pin bowling (where perfect 300 games happen regularly), **no one has ever bowled a perfect 300 in candlepin bowling**. The highest recorded score is 245.

A **good candlepin bowler** averages around 100-120. A score above 200 is exceptional.

## A Brief History of Candlepin Bowling

Candlepin bowling was **invented in 1880** in Worcester, Massachusetts, by Justin White, a local bowling alley owner.

## Tips for First-Time Candlepin Bowlers

If you're trying candlepin for the first time, here's what to know:

### 1. **Forget Everything You Know About Ten-Pin**
The small ball and skinny pins require a completely different approach. Don't expect strikes.

### 2. **Use Deadwood to Your Advantage**
Since fallen pins stay on the lane, try to use them strategically to knock down standing pins. It's like billiards meets bowling.

### 3. **Focus on Accuracy Over Power**
The light ball means power doesn't help much. Aim carefully and focus on hitting pins directly.

### 4. **Don't Get Discouraged**
Even experienced bowlers struggle with candlepin. A score of 90-100 is perfectly respectable for beginners.

### 5. **Have Fun**
Candlepin is quirky, challenging, and uniquely New England. Embrace the difficulty and enjoy the experience.
