# Types of Bowling: Duckpin, Candlepin, Ten-Pin & More Explained

When most people think of bowling, they picture **ten-pin bowling** — the standard format with heavy balls, tall pins, and automatic scoring.

But did you know there are **several different types of bowling**, each with unique rules, equipment, and challenges?

From the tricky **candlepin** game to the compact **duckpin** format, let's explore the fascinating world of bowling variations.

---

## 1. Ten-Pin Bowling (Standard Bowling)

**The most popular form of bowling worldwide.**

### How It Works:
- **10 tall pins** arranged in a triangle
- **Heavy balls** (6-16 lbs) with finger holes
- **Two attempts** per frame to knock down all pins
- **10 frames** per game

### Where You'll Find It:
Everywhere! This is the standard format in most bowling alleys.

### Why It's Popular:
Easy to learn, widely accessible, and works for all skill levels. Plus, those satisfying **strikes** never get old.

## 2. Duckpin Bowling

**Smaller pins, smaller balls, bigger challenge.**

### How It Works:
- **10 shorter, squatter pins** (they look like little ducks)
- **No finger holes** — balls are small (4-5 inches) and light (3-4 lbs)
- **Three attempts** per frame (instead of two)
- Much **harder to get strikes** due to lighter balls

### Where You'll Find It:
Mostly in the **Northeastern U.S.** and **Maritime Canada** (especially Maryland, Connecticut, and Massachusetts).

### Why It's Fun:
The smaller balls make it accessible for kids and beginners, but the difficulty of knocking down all the pins keeps it challenging. No perfect game (300) has ever been bowled in duckpin!

## 3. Candlepin Bowling

**Tall, thin pins and no second chances.**

### How It Works:
- **10 tall, thin pins** shaped like candles
- **Small balls** (4.5 inches, 2-3 lbs) with no finger holes
- **Dead wood stays on the lane** — knocked-down pins remain and can help (or hinder) your next shot
- **Three attempts** per frame
- Extremely difficult — the highest recorded score is **245** (out of 300)

### Where You'll Find It:
Primarily in **New England** (Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire) and parts of **Canada**.

### Why It's Unique:
Candlepin is known for being the **hardest type of bowling**. The thin pins and light balls make strikes incredibly rare, and the dead wood mechanic adds a layer of strategy.

## 4. Five-Pin Bowling

**A Canadian classic with a unique scoring system.**

### How It Works:
- **5 pins** arranged in a V-shape
- **Small, handheld balls** (5 inches, no finger holes)
- Pins have **different point values**:
  - Center pin (headpin): **5 points**
  - Two pins on either side: **3 points each**
  - Two corner pins: **2 points each**
- **Three attempts** per frame

### Where You'll Find It:
Almost exclusively in **Canada** — it's considered Canada's version of bowling.

### Why It's Different:
The scoring system rewards precision. You can score high without getting strikes, as long as you hit the high-value pins.

## 5. Nine-Pin Bowling (Kegel)

**The ancestor of ten-pin bowling.**

### How It Works:
- **9 pins** arranged in a diamond shape
- Similar rules to ten-pin, but with fewer pins
- Popular in parts of **Europe** (especially Germany, Austria, and Switzerland)

### Where You'll Find It:
Mostly in **Central Europe**, though some specialty alleys in the U.S. offer it.

### Why It Matters:
This is the **original American bowling format** before ten-pin took over. It's still widely played in Europe and has a rich competitive scene.

## 6. Bumper Bowling

**Not a separate type — but worth mentioning!**

Bumper bowling uses **gutter guards** to prevent balls from falling into the gutters, making it perfect for **kids and beginners**.

Available in most bowling alleys, bumper bowling makes the game more forgiving and fun for young bowlers still learning control.
