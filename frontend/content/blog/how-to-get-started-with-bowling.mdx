# How to Get Started with Bowling

Bowling is one of the easiest sports to pick up — and one of the most fun to play with friends and family.  
Here’s a quick beginner’s guide to get started.

---

## 🎟 Step 1 — Go to a Local Alley
Use the [Locations](/locations) page to find a bowling alley near you.  
Most will have open lanes for walk-ins, especially on weekdays.

---

## 👟 Step 2 — Rent Shoes and Pick a Ball
- Rent bowling shoes at the front desk (they help you slide safely)
- Choose a ball that feels comfortable:
  - About 10% of your body weight
  - Snug finger holes, but not too tight

---

## 🎯 Step 3 — Learn the Basics
- Each game has **10 frames** (turns)
- You get **two rolls per frame**
- Knock down all 10 pins = **strike**
- Knock them all down in two tries = **spare**
- The goal is to get the highest score possible (300 is a perfect game!)

---

## 🤝 Step 4 — Go With Friends and Have Fun
Bowling is all about having a good time.  
Celebrate strikes, laugh at gutter balls, and enjoy the experience.

---

## 🏁 Ready to Roll?
Now you’re ready for your first game.  
Find a local alley on [BowlingAlleys.io](/locations), grab your shoes, and get rolling.
