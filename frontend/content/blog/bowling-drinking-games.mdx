# Bowling Drinking Games: 7 Fun Games to Play With Friends

Going out for a night of bowling is already fun—but adding a few lighthearted drinking games can make it even more memorable. Whether you’re celebrating a birthday, having a weekend hangout, or just want to mix things up, these games combine friendly competition with a twist. Remember: always play responsibly and know your limits.  

Here are some of the top bowling drinking games you can try with friends next time you hit the lanes.

---

## 1. Beer Frame  
This one’s a classic. Whenever everyone in your group bowls a strike or spare **except one person**, that unlucky bowler owes the table a round of drinks (or takes a sip of their own). It keeps the pressure high and the laughs rolling.

---

## 2. Strike Shot  
It’s simple: if you bowl a strike, everyone else has to take a drink. If you bowl a gutter ball, you’re the one taking two drinks. This one gets fun quickly when strikes and gutters start flying back to back.

---

## 3. Spare Dare  
Whenever you pick up a spare, you get to assign a “dare” to another player—like taking a sip, singing a song, or doing a goofy dance before their next throw. Missed spares? Take a drink yourself!

---

## 4. Frame Assignments  
Before the game starts, assign each frame a rule. For example:  
- **Frame 1**: Everyone takes a sip no matter what.  
- **Frame 3**: Lowest score drinks.  
- **Frame 7**: Strike equals everyone cheers and drinks together.  

By the 10th frame, the rules have usually added up to a hilarious finish.

---

## 5. Gutter Ball Punishment  
Easy to remember: every gutter ball equals one drink. If you somehow throw two gutter balls in the same frame… that’s two drinks. No excuses!

---

## 6. Booze Bowling  
This is the ultimate bowling drinking game with a full ruleset. Your pin count determines how much you drink—knock down 7 pins and leave 3 standing? Take 3 sips. Roll a strike? You get to give out 10 sips to your friends. It includes special rules like waterfalls for turkeys and rhyme time challenges.

---

## 7. Last Place Drinks  
At the end of the game, the person with the lowest score owes the table a round—or has to finish their drink. It’s the ultimate motivation to bowl your best.

---

## Tips for Playing Responsibly  
- **Pace yourself.** Bowling games can go on for an hour or more, so take your time.  
- **Stay hydrated.** Alternate drinks with water.  
- **Know your limits.** These games are meant to be fun, not overwhelming.

Bowling drinking games are a great way to bond with friends and create stories you’ll laugh about later. Next time you head out, try one of these games and see which becomes your group’s favorite.
