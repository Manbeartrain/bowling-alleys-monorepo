# How to Score Bowling (Simple Guide + Scoring Chart Explained)

Bowling scoring can seem confusing at first — especially with all those strikes, spares, and mysterious symbols on the scoreboard.

But once you understand the basics, it's actually pretty simple.

This guide breaks down **exactly how bowling scoring works**, from basic rules to calculating strikes and spares like a pro.

---

## The Basics: 10 Frames, 2 Rolls Per Frame

A bowling game has **10 frames**.  
In each frame, you get **up to 2 rolls** to knock down all 10 pins.

### Scoring Breakdown:
- **Frame 1–9**: Up to 2 rolls per frame
- **Frame 10**: Special rules (explained below)
- **Maximum Score**: 300 (a perfect game)

Your score for each frame = **total pins knocked down** + **any bonus points** from strikes or spares.

---

## How to Score Each Roll

### Open Frame (No Strike or Spare)
If you don't knock down all 10 pins in 2 rolls, you score **only the pins you knocked down**.

**Example:**
- Roll 1: 6 pins
- Roll 2: 2 pins
- **Frame Score: 8**

Simple. No bonuses.

---

## Spare Scoring: Knock Down All 10 Pins in 2 Rolls

A **spare** happens when you knock down all 10 pins using **both rolls** in a frame.

### Spare Bonus:
You get **10 points** + the pins knocked down on your **next roll**.

**Example:**
- Frame 1: Roll 1 = 7, Roll 2 = 3 → **Spare!**
- Frame 2: Roll 1 = 5
- **Frame 1 Score: 10 + 5 = 15**

The spare bonus is added **after** you bowl your next roll.

---

## Strike Scoring: Knock Down All 10 Pins in 1 Roll

A **strike** happens when you knock down all 10 pins on your **first roll** of a frame.

### Strike Bonus:
You get **10 points** + the pins knocked down on your **next 2 rolls**.

**Example:**
- Frame 1: Roll 1 = **Strike!**
- Frame 2: Roll 1 = 6, Roll 2 = 3
- **Frame 1 Score: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19**

Strikes give bigger bonuses than spares because they count your next **two rolls** instead of just one.

---

## Double and Turkey (Multiple Strikes in a Row)

### Double (Two Strikes in a Row)
When you bowl **two strikes in a row**, the first strike bonus includes **10 pins from the second strike** + your next roll.

**Example:**
- Frame 1: **Strike**
- Frame 2: **Strike**
- Frame 3: Roll 1 = 7
- **Frame 1 Score: 10 + 10 + 7 = 27**
- **Frame 2 Score: 10 + 7 + (next roll) = ...**

### Turkey (Three Strikes in a Row)
Three strikes in a row is called a **turkey** 🦃.

**Example:**
- Frame 1: **Strike** → Score = 10 + 10 + 10 = **30** (the max per frame!)
- Frame 2: **Strike** → Score = 10 + 10 + (next roll)
- Frame 3: **Strike** → Score = 10 + (next 2 rolls)

The more strikes you bowl in a row, the higher your score climbs.

---

## The 10th Frame: Special Bonus Rules

The **10th frame** has unique scoring rules to allow for bonus rolls.

### Rules:
1. **If you bowl a strike**: You get **2 bonus rolls**
2. **If you bowl a spare**: You get **1 bonus roll**
3. **If you bowl an open frame**: No bonus rolls

### Scoring the 10th Frame:
- Your score = **all pins knocked down** in the 10th frame (including bonus rolls)
- There are no additional bonuses — just count the pins

**Example 1: Strike in the 10th Frame**
- Roll 1: **Strike** (10 pins)
- Bonus Roll 1: **Strike** (10 pins)
- Bonus Roll 2: 7 pins
- **10th Frame Score: 10 + 10 + 7 = 27**

**Example 2: Spare in the 10th Frame**
- Roll 1: 6 pins
- Roll 2: 4 pins (**Spare**)
- Bonus Roll: **Strike** (10 pins)
- **10th Frame Score: 6 + 4 + 10 = 20**

## How to Calculate Your Total Score

Your **total score** is the sum of all 10 frames.

### Example Game:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Frame</th>
      <th>Roll 1</th>
      <th>Roll 2</th>
      <th>Bonus (Rule Applied)</th>
      <th>Frame Score</th>
      <th>Running Total</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>—</td>
      <td>9</td>
      <td>9</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>9</td>
      <td>/ (spare)</td>
      <td>Next roll: 7</td>
      <td>17</td>
      <td>26</td>
    </tr>

      <td>X (strike)</td>
      <td>—</td>
      <td>Next two rolls: 6 + 3</td>
      <td>19</td>
      <td>53</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>X (strike)</td>
      <td>—</td>
      <td>Next two rolls: 10 + 7</td>
      <td>27</td>
      <td>89</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>X (strike)</td>
      <td>—</td>
      <td>Next two rolls: 7 + 2</td>
      <td>19</td>
      <td>108</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>8</td>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>—</td>
      <td>9</td>
      <td>117</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>9</td>
      <td>8</td>
      <td>/ (spare)</td>
      <td>Next roll: 10</td>
      <td>20</td>
      <td>137</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>10</td>
      <td>X, X, 7</td>
      <td>—</td>
      <td>Two bonus rolls (10th frame)</td>
      <td>27</td>
      <td><strong>164</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

**Final Score: 164**

## Perfect Game: How to Score 300

A **perfect game** means bowling **12 strikes in a row** (one in each frame, plus 2 bonus strikes in the 10th).

### Perfect Game Breakdown:
- Frames 1–9: **Strike** = 30 points each (10 + next 2 rolls, which are also strikes)
- Frame 10: **Strike, Strike, Strike** = 30 points
- **Total: 30 × 10 = 300**

Only about **1 in 11,500 bowlers** will ever bowl a perfect game. It's rare, but possible!

## Common Scoring Symbols

Most bowling alleys use **electronic scoring**, but here are the common symbols you'll see:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Symbol</th>
      <th>Meaning</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td><strong>X</strong></td><td>Strike</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>/</strong></td><td>Spare</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>–</strong></td><td>Gutter ball (0 pins)</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>F</strong></td><td>Foul (stepped over the line)</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Number</strong></td><td>Pins knocked down</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Scoring Tips for Beginners

### 1. **Aim for Spares**
Even if you don't get strikes, converting spares keeps your score climbing. A bowler who knocks down 9 pins every frame and converts all spares will score **190** — better than most casual bowlers!

### 2. **Strikes Are Worth More in Later Frames**
A strike in the 10th frame can add more points than one in the 1st frame because of the bonus rolls.

### 3. **Use the Scoreboard**
Modern alleys calculate your score automatically. Focus on your technique, and let the machine do the math.

## 🎳 Final Thoughts

Bowling scoring isn't as complicated as it seems — it's just **simple addition with a few bonus rules**.

Once you understand strikes, spares, and the 10th frame, you'll never be confused by the scoreboard again.

Now that you know how to score, it's time to hit the lanes and put it into practice!
