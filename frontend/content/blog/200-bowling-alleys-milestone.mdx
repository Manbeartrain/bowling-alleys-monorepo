# BowlingAlleys.io Hits 200 Bowling Alleys — And We're Just Getting Started

We've got exciting news: **BowlingAlleys.io has officially crossed 200 bowling alley listings** across the United States!

When we launched, our mission was simple but ambitious — **end bowling information secrecy**. No more calling alleys just to find out if they're open. No more guessing about pricing. No more wondering which venues have cosmic bowling or league nights.

Today, we're proud to say we're delivering on that promise with **200+ bowling alleys** featuring transparent pricing, verified hours, and real user reviews.

## Why 200 Matters

Doubling from 100 to 200 alleys isn't just a numbers game — it's about **coverage and trust**.

With 200 venues live, we now offer:

- **Nationwide reach** — From major metro areas to small-town gems across America
- **Price transparency** — Real per-game rates, hourly pricing, and shoe rental costs upfront
- **Complete amenity info** — Cosmic bowling schedules, league nights, birthday party packages, and more
- **Verified details** — Hours, phone numbers, and addresses you can count on
- **Real reviews** — Honest feedback from bowlers who've actually been there

Whether you're planning a casual Friday night, organizing a corporate event, or looking for a competitive league, you can now compare venues side-by-side before you even leave your house.
