# What Your Bowling Ball Color Says About You 🎯

We didn’t make the rules.  
We just read the vibes.  

Your bowling ball color says **way more** about you than your LinkedIn headline ever could.  

Let’s break it down 👇

---

## 🔴 Red — “The Tryhard”  
You walked in like it’s the PBA Finals.  
Wrist guard on. Rosin bag ready.  
Stretching like you’re about to run a 4x100 relay.  
We respect it… but also relax, Coach K.

---

## 🔵 Blue — “Mr. Smooth”  
You glide to the lane like elevator jazz.  
Form so clean it belongs in a museum.  
Still lose to your cousin who throws granny style,  
but hey… you *look* like a 300.

---

## 🩷 Pink — “The Chaos Agent”  
You didn’t even know you were coming bowling today.  
Yet here you are, throwing a strike, then a gutter, then dancing on the ball return.  
Half the alley wants to date you, the other half wants your Spotify playlist.

---

## ⚫ Black — “The Assassin”  
You haven’t smiled once.  
Your ball hits the pins like it found out they were talking behind its back.  
You keep score on paper. In pen.  
Honestly? We’re scared of you. And kinda impressed.

---

## 🌈 Swirl — “The Wildcard”  
You picked your ball because it was **“pretty.”**  
Now you’re casually dropping turkeys like it’s brunch.  
Physics doesn’t apply to you.  
Are you lucky or cursed? Either way, we’re watching.

---

## 🟢 Green — “The Guy Who Says ‘Bowla’”  
You call bowling “bowla.”  
Nobody likes it…  
…but somehow everyone laughs when you do.  
You’ll never win a game, but you *will* win the group photo.
