## The Quick Answer: Pizza Calculator by Group Size

Here's your cheat sheet based on standard 8-slice large pizzas:

### For Adults (Ages 13+)
- **4 people**: 2-3 pizzas (16-24 slices)
- **8 people**: 4-5 pizzas (32-40 slices)
- **12 people**: 6-7 pizzas (48-56 slices)
- **16 people**: 8-10 pizzas (64-80 slices)
- **20 people**: 10-12 pizzas (80-96 slices)

### For Kids (Ages 5-12)
- **8 kids**: 2-3 pizzas (16-24 slices)
- **12 kids**: 3-4 pizzas (24-32 slices)
- **16 kids**: 4-5 pizzas (32-40 slices)

### Mixed Groups (Adults + Kids)
**Calculate separately, then combine:**
- Count adults × 3 slices per person
- Count kids × 2 slices per person
- Divide total slices by 8 to get number of pizzas
- **Add 1-2 extra pizzas as buffer**

---

## The Formula: Slices Per Person

**Standard rule**: Plan for **2.5-3 slices per adult** when other food is available, or **3-4 slices** if pizza is the main meal.

### Why Bowling Changes the Math

Bowling burns calories and builds appetite:
- **Light bowlers** (1-2 games, casual pace): 2-3 slices
- **Serious bowlers** (3+ games, competitive): 3-4 slices
- **All-night sessions** (4+ hours): 4-5 slices

**Pro tip**: Add an extra pizza for every 2 hours beyond the first hour.

---

## Factors That Affect Pizza Quantities

### 1. **Duration of Bowling**
- **1-2 hours**: Standard portions (2-3 slices/person)
- **3-4 hours**: Add 25% more pizza
- **5+ hours (league night/marathon)**: Add 50% more pizza

### 2. **Time of Day**
- **Lunch bowling** (11am-2pm): People eat less (2 slices average)
- **Dinner bowling** (5pm-8pm): People eat more (3-4 slices average)
- **Late night** (9pm+): Order extra—night bowling makes people hungry!

### 3. **Age & Activity Level**
- **Teenagers**: Add 1 extra pizza per 6 teens (they can eat!)
- **Young kids (under 10)**: 1.5-2 slices each
- **Seniors**: 2 slices average
- **Competitive bowlers**: 3-4 slices (bowling is a workout!)

### 4. **Other Food Available**
- **Pizza only**: Use higher estimates (3-4 slices/person)
- **Appetizers available**: Reduce by 20% (2-3 slices/person)
- **Full meal with sides**: Reduce by 30% (2 slices/person)

---

## Pizza Size Matters: Large vs. Medium vs. Personal

### Standard Pizza Sizes
- **Personal (6-7")**: 4 slices = 1 person
- **Medium (12")**: 6-8 slices = 2-3 people
- **Large (14-16")**: 8-10 slices = 3-4 people
- **Extra Large (18")**: 10-12 slices = 4-5 people

### The Large Pizza Advantage

**Always order large pizzas for groups.** Here's why:

**Math breakdown:**
- 2 medium pizzas = 12-16 slices = $16-20
- 1 large pizza = 8-10 slices = $12-15

**But large pizzas have 30% more pizza per dollar.** Plus, you'll have fewer boxes cluttering your bowling area.

## Variety Strategy: What Types to Order

### The Proven Mix for Groups

**For 8 people (4-5 pizzas):**
- 2 pepperoni (crowd favorite)
- 1 cheese (for picky eaters)
- 1 supreme/combo
- 1 specialty (BBQ chicken, Hawaiian, veggie)

**For 16 people (8-10 pizzas):**
- 3-4 pepperoni
- 2 cheese
- 2 supreme/combo
- 1-2 specialty options

### Pro Tips for Variety
- **Always include 1 cheese pizza** (vegetarians, picky kids)
- **Go heavy on pepperoni** (80% of people like it)
- **Ask about dietary restrictions** before ordering
- **Keep 1 veggie option** in the mix
- **Avoid super spicy/weird combos** for big groups

## Bowling Alley Pizza Tips

### 1. **Order Early**
- **Weekend nights**: Order 1-2 hours ahead
- **League nights**: Order 2-3 hours ahead (kitchens get slammed)
- **Special events**: Order the day before if possible

### 2. **Delivery Timing**
- Order pizza to arrive **30-45 minutes after you start bowling**
- This gives everyone time to settle in and work up an appetite
- **Never** order pizza to arrive when you arrive (it'll sit and get cold)

### 3. **The One-Hand Rule**
Choose pizzas you can eat with one hand:
- Thin crust or hand-tossed (NOT deep dish)
- Minimal toppings that slide off
- Avoid super greasy options (harder to bowl after)

### 4. **Ask About Bowling Specials**
Many bowling alleys offer:
- Package deals (lanes + pizza + drinks)
- Group discounts on pizza orders
- Free delivery to lanes
- **Call ahead to ask!**

## Common Pizza Ordering Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### ❌ **Mistake #1: Ordering Too Little**
**The fix**: When in doubt, round up. Cold pizza is better than no pizza.

### ❌ **Mistake #2: All Different Toppings**
**The fix**: 60% safe choices (pepperoni/cheese), 40% variety.

### ❌ **Mistake #3: Ignoring Dietary Restrictions**
**The fix**: Ask ahead! Order 1 gluten-free and 1 veggie option for groups of 12+.

### ❌ **Mistake #4: Ordering Too Early**
**The fix**: Time delivery for 30-45 minutes after bowling starts.

### ❌ **Mistake #5: Forgetting Drinks & Napkins**
**The fix**: Budget 2 drinks per person. Request extra napkins (greasy fingers ruin bowling!)
