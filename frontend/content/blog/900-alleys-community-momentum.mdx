This week brought us something special: **900 bowling alleys** on BowlingAlleys.io.

We're not just adding numbers to a list—we're building America's most complete bowling directory, one verified alley at a time. And this week's growth shows that the bowling community is starting to take notice.

## The Numbers That Matter

Here's what happened this week:

### 900+ Bowling Alleys Nationwide

We officially crossed the **900-alley milestone**. That's 900 verified venues with accurate hours, real pricing, detailed amenities, and honest reviews.

From family-owned centers in small towns to entertainment complexes in major metros, we're documenting every lane across all 50 states.

### 20 New Community Members

**20 people joined BowlingAlleys.io this week**—bowlers who are tired of outdated Google listings and want a platform built specifically for finding great lanes.

They're leaving reviews, saving favorite alleys, and helping us build the most transparent bowling resource in America.

### Nearly 10 Claimed Alleys

**Almost 10 bowling alley owners claimed their listings** this week—a significant jump in venue ownership engagement.

These are alley owners who:
- Want to keep their information accurate
- Are responding to customer reviews
- Are updating pricing and photos in real-time
- Understand the value of transparency

For bowling alley owners who haven't claimed yet: [claim your listing here](/owner). It's free, it's fast, and it puts you in control of how your alley is presented to thousands of bowlers searching for their next game.

## Why This Week Matters

Crossing 900 alleys isn't just about hitting a round number. It's proof that BowlingAlleys.io is becoming the go-to resource for:

**Bowlers** who want transparent pricing and accurate information before they show up.

**Alley owners** who want to reach more customers and showcase what makes their venue special.

**The bowling community** that deserves better than scattered reviews and outdated business listings.

## What's Driving the Growth

Three things are fueling our momentum right now:

### 1. Pricing Transparency

Bowlers are tired of "call for rates." We list actual game prices, shoe rentals, and package deals upfront. No surprises. No hidden fees. Just honest information.

### 2. Experience-Based Discovery

Our [experience pages](/cosmic-bowling) let you find alleys by what you actually want to do—cosmic bowling, leagues, birthday parties, wheelchair accessibility. It's how search should work.

### 3. Owner Engagement

More alley owners are claiming their listings every week because they see the value: accurate information, customer reviews, and a platform that actually helps them connect with bowlers.

## The Founding Partners Program: 35 Spots Left

We're at **15 Founding Partners** with **35 spots remaining** in our exclusive program for the first 50 alleys to claim their listings.

Founding Partners get:
- Permanent recognition with a purple crown badge

## What's Next

We're not slowing down. Here's what's coming:

**1,000 alleys.** We're less than 100 away and adding verified venues daily.

**Enhanced city coverage.** More hub pages with curated recommendations, interactive maps, and local insights.

**Better discovery tools.** New filtering options, saved favorites, and personalized recommendations.

**Stronger community features.** More ways for bowlers and owners to connect and share what they love about bowling.
