Looking to knock down more pins tonight? You don’t need weeks of practice to see improvement. With just a few quick adjustments, you can walk into your local alley (find one on BowlingAlleys.io!) and start scoring higher immediately.  

Here are five easy fixes you can try **right now**:  

## 1. Choose the Right Ball Weight
If your ball feels too heavy, you’ll lose control. Too light, and you won’t generate enough pin action. A quick rule of thumb: pick a ball that’s about **10% of your body weight**, up to 16 pounds. At your alley, grab a few balls and roll them down the lane—choose the one that feels comfortable from start to finish.  

## 2. Focus on Your Starting Position
Many beginners step up without thinking about where they’re standing. Line up with your target arrow (not the pins!) and place your feet slightly to the side of your bowling hand. Small changes in where you stand can help straighten out your throws and avoid gutter balls.  

## 3. Watch the Arrows, Not the Pins
Most lanes have arrows about 15 feet down. Aim for those instead of the pins—they give you a more accurate target. This trick alone can immediately improve your accuracy and help you hit the pocket more often.  

## 4. Smooth Out Your Release
Don’t overthink the spin—just aim for a smooth, straight release. Avoid squeezing the ball too tightly. Let your hand flow forward naturally and release at ankle level. A relaxed release equals more consistent shots.  

## 5. Stay Balanced After the Throw
Watch your finish! If you’re stumbling or off-balance, your ball is too. Keep your sliding foot steady, your shoulders square, and hold your follow-through for a second. Balance at the end of the shot is a big sign that your throw was clean.
