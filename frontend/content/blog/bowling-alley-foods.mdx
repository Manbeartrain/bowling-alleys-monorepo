## The Ultimate Bowling Food Strategy

Here's how to plan your eating around a full night of bowling:

### Before You Bowl (30 min prior):
- Light meal with protein (grilled chicken sandwich)
- Hydrate well

### During Bowling:
- **Between games**: Quick snacks (fruit, veggie sticks)
- **Mid-session break**: Bigger item with utensils (chicken tenders)
- **Hydration**: Water or sports drinks (in cups with lids and straws)

### After Bowling:
- Now you can enjoy the messy stuff
- Wings, pizza, loaded fries — go wild
- Your game is done, so your grip doesn't matter

## Keep Your Ball (and Hands) Clean

Even with smart food choices, maintenance is key:

### Essential Supplies:
- **Bowling towel**: Wipe your ball before every shot
- **Hand wipes**: Quick clean between frames
- **Hand sanitizer**: Alcohol-based for oil removal
- **Extra napkins**: Stock up at the counter

### Quick Hand Check:
1. Look at your palm — any shine?
2. Rub fingers together — feel any slip?
3. Smell test — any food odor?
4. If any answer is yes: **wash your hands**

---

## Hydration Without the Mess

Don't forget about drinks:

### Best Beverage Choices:
- **Water in a cup with lid and straw**
- **Sports drinks** (for long sessions)
- **Bottled water** (easiest, cleanest)

### Avoid:
- **Sticky sodas** without lids (spills everywhere)
- **Beer or cocktails** in sweaty glasses (slippery hands)
- **Energy drinks** (too much sugar leaves residue)

**Pro Tip**: Use a straw to avoid getting the cup rim sticky.
