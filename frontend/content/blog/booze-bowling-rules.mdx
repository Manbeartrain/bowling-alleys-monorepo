# Booze Bowling: The Ultimate Drinking Game for the Lanes

Looking for a way to make your next bowling night legendary? Booze Bowling is a classic drinking game that ties your performance on the lanes directly to how much you drink. The better you bowl, the less you drink (and the more you can dish out to your friends). It's been a staple of casual bowling nights for decades, and now you can bring it to your next group outing.

**Important:** Always drink responsibly and know your limits. Make sure everyone has a safe ride home.

## Basic Rules

The core concept is simple: your pin count determines your drinking. Follow normal bowling rules, but after each frame, check the table below to see what happens.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Frame Score</th>
      <th>Action</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Strike (X)</td><td>Give out 10 sips</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Double (XX)</td><td>Give out 20 sips AND make a rule</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Turkey (XXX+)</td><td>Waterfall!</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Spare (/)</td><td>No drinks</td></tr>
    <tr><td>9 pins</td><td>Take 1 sip</td></tr>
    <tr><td>8 pins</td><td>Take 2 sips</td></tr>
    <tr><td>7 pins</td><td>Take 3 sips</td></tr>
    <tr><td>6 pins</td><td>Take 4 sips</td></tr>
    <tr><td>5 pins</td><td>Take 5 sips</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4 pins</td><td>Take 6 sips</td></tr>
    <tr><td>3 pins</td><td>Take 7 sips</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2 pins</td><td>Take 8 sips</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1 pin</td><td>Take 9 sips</td></tr>
    <tr><td>0 pins (Gutter)</td><td>Take 10 sips</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Foot foul</td><td>Take 10 sips</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Pick up a split</td><td>Give out sips equal to the split</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Spill your drink</td><td>Bowl with opposite arm for remaining frames</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

When you get a strike or pick up a split, you can distribute your "give" sips however you want: all to one person or spread across multiple friends.

## Special Rules

These bonus rules keep the game interesting and add extra moments of chaos throughout your bowling session.

### Making Rules (Double Strike)

When you roll two strikes in a row, you give out 20 sips AND get to make up a rule. Rules can be anything creative, but they can't target specific people. Examples:
- Everyone must bowl with their non-dominant hand
- No using anyone's real name
- Must high-five after every frame

Your rule stays in effect until someone else gets a double.

### Waterfall (Turkey)

Three strikes in a row triggers a waterfall! Everyone lines up by current score (highest to lowest), with the turkey bowler going first. Everyone starts drinking at the same time. When the first person puts down their drink, the next person can stop, and so on down the line.

### Categories

If everyone in your group rolls the same pin count in any frame, it's time for Categories. The player with the highest score picks a category (sports teams, movie titles, pizza toppings, etc.). Going clockwise, each player names something in that category. No repeats allowed, and you have 10 seconds to answer. First person who can't name something drinks the frame's pin total.

### Pitcher Perfect

If everyone except one person gets a strike in a frame, the non-striker buys a pitcher for the group.

### Frame Five is Guys

In the 5th frame, the male bowler with the lowest pin count drinks 5 sips.

### Frame Six is Chicks

In the 6th frame, the female bowler with the lowest pin count drinks 6 sips.

### Frame Nine is Rhyme Time

Stand in a circle. The bowler with the highest score says a word. Going clockwise, each person must say a rhyming word. No repeats, no proper names, and you have 10 seconds. First person who can't rhyme drinks 9 sips. Pro tip: Don't pick "orange."

### Buzz Words

Before the game starts, the group picks a few "buzz words" that are off-limits. These could be bowling-related ("strike," "gutter") or inside jokes. Any bowler caught using a buzz word takes a sip. Avoid picking common words like "the" or "and" unless you want chaos.

## End of Game

Playing on teams? The losing team drinks the difference. If your 5-person team loses by 50 pins, each player takes 10 sips. It's motivation to bowl your best until the very last frame.

## Tips for a Great Booze Bowling Night

1. **Use sips, not shots.** The game is designed for sipping beer, wine, or mixed drinks over a full game.
2. **Pace yourself.** A bowling game can last an hour or more, so there's no rush.
3. **Stay hydrated.** Keep water on the table and alternate between drinks.
4. **Know your limits.** The point is to have fun, not to overdo it.
5. **Plan your ride.** Make sure everyone has a safe way home before you start.
