One week ago, we celebrated hitting 1,000 bowling alleys.

Today? **1,100.**

That's 100 new verified venues in just seven days — our fastest growth week yet. And we're not slowing down.

## The Numbers Tell a Story

**1,100 bowling alleys** means:
- 1,100 venues with accurate hours
- 1,100 locations with transparent pricing
- 1,100 alleys with detailed amenities
- 1,100 places for bowlers to discover

From Alaska to Florida, from Maine to California — we're documenting every lane in America.

## Why the Acceleration?

Three things are fueling this rapid growth:

### 1. Word of Mouth is Spreading

Bowlers are telling other bowlers. Alley owners are telling other owners. What started as a small directory is becoming **the place** to find bowling in America.

People are tired of:
- Calling alleys just to ask about prices
- Hunting through outdated websites
- Relying on incomplete Google listings

They want one place with **everything** — and that's exactly what we're building.

### 2. More Owners are Claiming Listings

Smart bowling alley owners are realizing that BowlingAlleys.io isn't just another directory — it's a **high-intent traffic source** bringing thousands of bowlers directly to their venue pages.

When you claim your listing, you get:
- Full control over your information
- Ability to respond to reviews
- Analytics on who's viewing your page
- Direct connection to bowlers searching for exactly what you offer

And it's **completely free**. [Claim your listing here](/owner).

### 3. Experience-Based Discovery Works

Our [experience pages](/cosmic-bowling) are outperforming traditional "bowling near me" searches because they match **how people actually search**:

- [Cosmic Bowling](/cosmic-bowling) — "I want lights and music"
- [Birthday Parties](/birthday-parties) — "I need a party venue"
- [Bowling Leagues](/bowling-leagues) — "I want to join a league"
- [Sports Bar](/sports-bar) — "I want to bowl and watch the game"

This isn't just better UX. It's better for **everyone**:
- Bowlers find exactly what they're looking for
- Alleys attract customers interested in their specific offerings
- We build the best bowling discovery platform in America

## The Founding Partners Program: Still Open

We have **15 Founding Partners** with **35 spots remaining** in our exclusive program for the first 50 alleys to claim their listings.

**Founding Partners get:**
- Permanent purple crown badge
- Priority placement on experience pages
- Featured carousel spots
- Access to exclusive gamification features
- Enhanced visibility across the entire platform

As we approach 1,500 alleys by year-end, being one of the first 50 will mean something. [Join the Founding Partners program now](/founding-partners).

## This Week's Highlights

Beyond the 100-alley growth, here's what else happened:

### Expanded City Coverage

We added comprehensive coverage to multiple new cities this week, making it easier for local bowlers to discover great alleys in their area.

### Improved Search Functionality

Our search algorithm got smarter. Now when you search for things like "birthday party bowling" or "late night cosmic," you get exactly the alleys that offer those experiences.

### More Reviews Coming In

Bowlers continue leaving honest reviews, helping others make informed decisions. This community-driven transparency is exactly what the bowling industry needed.

## The Road to 1,500

We're **73% of the way** to our year-end goal of 1,500 bowling alleys.

At our current pace? We'll hit it early.

But we're not satisfied with just hitting numbers. Every single alley we add gets:
- Verified hours and contact info
- Accurate pricing (when available publicly)
- Complete amenity listings
- High-quality photos
- Integration into relevant experience pages

Quality at scale. That's the standard.

## What's Next

The momentum is building, and we're capitalizing on it:

### More City Hub Pages

We're launching dedicated city pages for major metros, giving bowlers comprehensive local guides and helping great alleys get discovered.

### Enhanced Analytics for Owners

Claimed venues will soon get detailed insights into who's viewing their pages, what amenities people care about, and how they stack up locally.

### Deeper Integration with Experience Pages

Every new alley strengthens our experience pages — making them more comprehensive and more valuable for discovery.
