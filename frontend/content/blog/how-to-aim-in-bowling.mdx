# How to Aim in Bowling: Arrows, Dots & Boards Explained (Beginner Guide)

If you've ever wondered why some bowlers consistently hit their target while others struggle with accuracy, the secret often comes down to one thing: **knowing where to aim**.

Most beginners make the mistake of staring at the pins 60 feet away. But here's the truth—professional bowlers rarely look at the pins. Instead, they use the **arrows, dots, and boards** built into every bowling lane as their targeting system.

In this guide, we'll break down exactly how to use these visual markers to dramatically improve your accuracy and consistency.

## The Three Targeting Systems

Every bowling lane has three main visual guides to help you aim:

### 1. **The Arrows**
Located about **15 feet down the lane**, the arrows are the most popular targeting system among bowlers of all skill levels. There are seven arrows total, evenly spaced across the lane.

### 2. **The Dots**
You'll find two sets of dots:
- **Approach dots**: Located near the foul line where you start your approach
- **Target dots**: About 7 feet down the lane, just before the arrows

### 3. **The Boards**
The lane is made up of 39 wooden boards, numbered from 1 to 39 (from right to left for right-handed bowlers). While you can't see numbers on the lane, each arrow and dot sits on a specific board number.

## Why Aim at Arrows, Not Pins?

**Targeting something closer to you is simply more accurate.**

Think of it like basketball—you don't stare at the backboard from half-court. You focus on a closer reference point. The same principle applies in bowling:

- **15 feet away** (arrows) is much easier to hit consistently than **60 feet away** (pins)
- The closer target helps you develop muscle memory
- It's easier to make adjustments based on what you see

## How to Use the Arrows (The Most Popular Method)

The arrows are the gold standard for bowling aim. Here's how to use them:

### Step 1: Find Your Starting Arrow
Most bowlers start by aiming at the **second arrow from the right** (for right-handers) or **second arrow from the left** (for left-handers). This is the most common strike target.

### Step 2: Stand at the Dots
Position your feet at the approach dots. For a straight ball, align your sliding foot with the same board as your target arrow.

### Step 3: Focus on the Arrow
As you approach, keep your eyes locked on your target arrow. Don't look up at the pins.

### Step 4: Roll Over the Arrow
Release the ball so it crosses directly over your target arrow.

### Step 5: Adjust as Needed
- If you miss **left of the pocket**, move your feet left or aim at an arrow to the right
- If you miss **right of the pocket**, move your feet right or aim at an arrow to the left

## The 3-6-9 Spare System (Using Arrows)

Professional bowlers use the arrow system to pick up spares consistently. Here's the formula:

**For right-handers:**
- **Right-side spares** (10-pin, 6-pin): Move 3 boards left from your strike position
- **Middle spares** (5-pin, 8-pin): Move 6 boards left
- **Left-side spares** (7-pin, 4-pin): Move 9 boards left

This systematic approach takes the guesswork out of spare shooting.

## Using the Dots (For Beginners and Straight Bowlers)

The dots near the foul line work well if you prefer to aim closer to your feet:

### Approach Dots Strategy
1. **Pick your target dot** on the lane (about 7 feet out)
2. **Align your stance** using the approach dots at your feet
3. **Walk straight** toward your target dot
4. **Release the ball** so it rolls over the dot

This method is great for beginners because everything happens in your immediate field of vision.

## Understanding the Boards (For Advanced Players)

Once you're comfortable with arrows and dots, learning the board system takes your game to the next level.

### Board Number Reference:
- **Board 20**: Dead center of the lane
- **Board 10**: Second arrow from right (right-handers' strike target)
- **Board 17-18**: The "pocket" for right-handers (between 1-3 pins)

### How Advanced Bowlers Use Boards:
Instead of saying "aim at the second arrow," they'll say "stand on board 25, roll over board 10." This precision allows for exact adjustments.

**Example:** "I stood on 23, threw over 12, and the ball hit high. Next shot, I'll stand on 25, throw over 10."

## Putting It All Together: Your Aiming Checklist

Here's your step-by-step aiming process:

1. **Choose your target** (start with the second arrow)
2. **Position your feet** at the approach dots
3. **Walk toward your target** with a straight approach
4. **Keep your eyes on the arrow or dot** throughout your approach
5. **Release smoothly** over your target
6. **Watch the ball path** and adjust accordingly

## Common Aiming Mistakes to Avoid

**❌ Looking at the pins** — This is the #1 mistake. Trust your target system instead.

**❌ Changing your target mid-approach** — Pick your target and commit to it.

**❌ Not adjusting** — If you're consistently missing, move your feet or change your target arrow.

**❌ Aiming too far ahead** — The arrows at 15 feet are optimal. Don't aim at the pins 60 feet away.

## Practice Drills to Improve Your Aim

### Drill 1: Arrow Accuracy
Roll 10 balls trying to hit the same arrow each time. Count how many actually cross over it.

### Drill 2: Dot Targeting
Place a piece of tape on your target dot. Practice until you can consistently hit it.

### Drill 3: Board Walking
Walk your approach without a ball, focusing on keeping your slide foot on the same board every time.

## Finding Your Personal Strike Line

Every bowler's strike line is different based on:
- Your release (straight vs. hook)
- Lane conditions (oil pattern)
- Ball speed and rev rate
- Your natural delivery angle

**Pro tip:** Once you find what works, write it down! "Board 23 to board 10" is a repeatable formula you can use at any bowling alley.

## Final Thoughts

Learning to use arrows, dots, and boards transforms bowling from a guessing game into a precision sport. Start with the arrows, master the basics, and gradually incorporate the board system as you improve.

The best part? These targeting systems work at every bowling alley in the country. Once you learn the system, you can walk into any lane and know exactly where to aim.
