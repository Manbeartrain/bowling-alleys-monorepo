This week brought us a milestone we've been pushing toward since day one: **1,000 bowling alleys** on BowlingAlleys.io.

And we're not celebrating alone. This week, we're proud to welcome **two new sponsors** who believe in what we're building: **Digital Art Dealers** and **Flextro**.

## The 1,000-Alley Milestone

We officially crossed **1,000 verified bowling alleys** this week. That's over 1,000 venues with accurate hours, transparent pricing, detailed amenities, and honest reviews.

From family-owned centers in small towns to entertainment complexes in major metros, we're documenting every lane across all 50 states.

### Why This Matters

Breaking through 1,000 alleys isn't just about hitting a round number. It's proof that:

- **Bowlers** are finding value in a platform built specifically for discovering great lanes
- **Alley owners** see the benefit of transparent, accurate listings
- **The bowling community** deserves—and is getting—better than outdated Google listings

We're building America's most complete bowling directory, one verified alley at a time.

## Welcoming Our New Sponsors

This week, we're excited to announce **two new sponsors** joining BowlingAlleys.io:

### Digital Art Dealers

**Digital Art Dealers** is now a proud sponsor of BowlingAlleys.io. They understand the value of community-driven platforms and are supporting our mission to bring transparency to bowling.

We're grateful for their partnership and excited to showcase their brand to thousands of bowlers nationwide.

### Flextro

**Flextro** joins us as our second new sponsor this week. Their commitment to supporting innovative platforms like ours demonstrates their forward-thinking approach.

Together, Digital Art Dealers and Flextro are helping us scale this platform and reach even more bowling enthusiasts across America.

### Why Sponsorships Matter

Sponsors like Digital Art Dealers and Flextro allow us to:
- Continue building features that help bowlers discover great alleys
- Maintain free access for all users
- Expand our venue database to 2,000+ alleys and beyond
- Invest in tools that help bowling alley owners succeed

**Thank you** to both Digital Art Dealers and Flextro for believing in BowlingAlleys.io.

## This Week's Growth

Beyond the 1,000-alley milestone, here's what else happened:

### Continued Community Engagement

Bowlers continue joining BowlingAlleys.io because they're tired of:
- Calling alleys just to get basic pricing
- Sorting through outdated Google reviews
- Visiting websites that don't show hours or amenities

They want **transparent information** and **experience-based discovery**—and that's exactly what we deliver.

### More Owners Claiming Their Listings

Bowling alley owners are discovering the value of BowlingAlleys.io:
- Keeping their information accurate and up-to-date
- Responding to customer reviews
- Showcasing what makes their venue special
- Reaching thousands of bowlers searching for their next game

## The Founding Partners Program: 35 Spots Remaining

**Founding Partners get:**
- Permanent recognition with a purple crown badge

## What's Driving Our Growth

Three things continue to fuel our momentum:

### 1. Pricing Transparency

We list actual game prices, shoe rentals, and package deals upfront. No "call for rates." No surprises. Just honest information that helps bowlers plan their night out.

### 2. Experience-Based Discovery

Our [experience pages](/cosmic-bowling) let you find alleys by what you actually want to do:
- [Cosmic Bowling](/cosmic-bowling) - Neon lights and music
- [Bowling Leagues](/bowling-leagues) - Competitive play
- [Birthday Parties](/birthday-parties) - Kids' celebrations
- [Sports Bar](/sports-bar) - Watch games while you bowl
- [Wheelchair Accessible](/wheelchair-accessible) - Inclusive bowling

It's search built around how people actually plan their bowling experiences.

### 3. Community and Partnerships

More alley owners are claiming their listings, more bowlers are leaving reviews, and now—more sponsors are supporting our mission.

This creates a flywheel: better data → more traffic → more engagement → better platform for everyone.

## What's Next

We're not slowing down. Here's what's coming:

### 1,500 Alleys by End of Year

We're adding verified venues daily and targeting **1,500 bowling alleys** by December 31st.

### Enhanced City Coverage

More premium city hub pages with:
- Curated venue recommendations
